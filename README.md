# simpleReveal
Simple js to reveal element inside the dom on scroll-resize-load page event

Just add 'reveal' class to your element and if you need a delay time for your element jsut add a 'data-dealy=1' (s) attribute

By default 'reveal' class switch to 'revealed' class, when element is in viewport, so the element will be showed with a opactiy transition ( 0 to 1).
