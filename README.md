# simpleReveal
Simple js to reveal element in viewport, on scroll-resize-load page events

Just add 'reveal' class to your element and if you need a delay time just add a 'data-dealy=1' (s) attribute to your element.

By default 'reveal' class switch to 'revealed' class, when element is in viewport, so the element will be showed with a opactiy transition (0 to 1).
